# This is definitely bugged. The pulley (13) seems to behave differently from the idler parts. 
# It might depend on the original orientation of the base frame, or the parent frame. I'm not sure at the moment.
# But this static definition works for now, and I need a break from thinking about this.

# The rpy,xyz offset is described in the child_frame (because the transformation is messily coded by hand) (MAYBE)
