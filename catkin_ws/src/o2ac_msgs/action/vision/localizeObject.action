# This action should be called when the camera looks at the tray or an object.
# The distance from the tray needs to match the part that is being searched.
# Small parts require "near" distance. Large ones (CAD-matching) require "far" distance.

# Request (sent from the action client to the action server)
string item_id     # Name of the item. The CAD model should be retrieved separately (o2ac_parts_description)

# Optional parameter:
# A guess where the object is expected to be. This could be used e.g. with YOLO,
# to define a region of interest.
geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped expected_pose

# Result (returned from the server to the client)

bool succeeded
float32[] confidences
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped[] detected_poses

# Optional
geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped[] detected_poses_with_covariance

---
# Feedback (values that can be sent to the client while the action is running)
